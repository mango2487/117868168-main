Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
That the order would stay relatively the same through the simulations (but not really lol 1000 and before)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
10,000 simulations makes sure to include all teams properly
